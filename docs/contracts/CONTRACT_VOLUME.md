# Lode Volume Model — Contract

This document defines the contract for the `Volume` persistence paradigm.
It is authoritative for all Volume implementations.

Status: **Active** (v0.6.0)

---

## Goals

1. Represent sparse, resumable byte-range persistence explicitly.
2. Preserve manifest-driven commit semantics for partial materialization workflows.
3. Keep adapter behavior backend-agnostic and lifecycle semantics explicit.

---

## Non-goals

- Torrent protocol behavior (pieces, peers, trackers).
- Networking, scheduling, runtime orchestration, or execution policy.
- Hidden background mutation or inference of missing ranges.

---

## Conceptual Model

### Volume

A logical byte address space `[0..N)` identified by `VolumeID` and `TotalLength`.

### VolumeSnapshot

An immutable commit that records the **cumulative** set of all verified
committed blocks across the volume's history. Each snapshot is self-contained:
its manifest is the sole authority for read visibility at that point in time.

### VolumeSnapshotID

A stable identifier for a committed Volume snapshot. Generated using Unix
nanoseconds (consistent with `DatasetSnapshotID`).

### BlockRef

A reference to a staged or committed byte block (offset, length, object path).
A block is not committed until included in a snapshot manifest.

Note: `BlockRef` is a Volume concept. The `DatasetReader` API uses
`ManifestRef` for dataset manifest locators.

### Volume Manifest

The authoritative description of committed blocks for a snapshot. Manifests
are **cumulative**: each manifest contains the full set of committed blocks,
not just the blocks added in that commit. This ensures every snapshot is
independently interpretable without chain traversal.

---

## Manifest Requirements

Volume manifests MUST include at minimum:
- schema name + version
- volume ID
- snapshot ID
- parent snapshot ID (when applicable)
- total length
- creation time
- explicit metadata object
- committed blocks list (**cumulative** — all blocks, not just new)

Each committed block MUST record:
- offset
- length
- immutable object reference/path
- optional checksum metadata when configured

Manifests are cumulative:
- Each manifest contains the full set of committed blocks across all
  prior commits, plus the new blocks added in this commit.
- A single manifest is sufficient to determine complete read visibility.
- No chain traversal is required to interpret a snapshot.

Absence is meaningful:
- Ranges not listed are uncommitted and MUST NOT be inferred.

---

## Write Lifecycle

Volume write lifecycle is explicit:

1. **Stage**: Data is written to the final storage path. Staged data is not
   visible to readers (no manifest references it). Staged data files use the
   path `volumes/<volume_id>/data/<offset>-<length>.bin`.
2. **Verify**: Caller/runtime validates data externally (e.g., hash check).
3. **Commit**: Verified blocks are recorded in a new immutable snapshot
   manifest alongside all previously committed blocks (cumulative).

Rules:
- Unverified or uncommitted blocks MUST NOT appear in committed manifests.
- Commit visibility is manifest-driven, same as Dataset.
- Snapshots are immutable once committed.
- Overlapping committed blocks within a snapshot are invalid and MUST return
  `ErrOverlappingBlocks`. Overlap validation applies to the full cumulative
  block set (existing + new), not just new blocks.
- Commit MUST include at least one new block. Empty commits (no new blocks)
  are invalid.

### Staged Data Lifecycle

Staged data is written directly to the final object path. Manifest-driven
visibility means uncommitted data files are invisible to readers — identical
to Dataset's partial-write behavior.

- Abandoned staged data (never committed) is harmless but may remain in storage.
- Cleanup of orphaned staged data is the caller's responsibility.
- No Volume-level Abort API is required.
- No implicit background cleanup is permitted.

### Resume Semantics

Resume is explicit and caller-driven.

- `Volume.Latest(ctx)` returns the most recent committed snapshot, which
  contains the cumulative set of all committed blocks.
- The caller determines which ranges are missing and re-stages them.
- Volume does NOT discover or recover uncommitted staged data.
- No hidden inference or data directory scanning is permitted.

---

## Read Semantics

Volume reads are range-first:
- `ReadAt(snapshotID, offset, length)` succeeds only if the entire requested
  range is covered by committed blocks.

Required behavior:
- If any sub-range is missing, return an explicit missing-range error.
- No zero-fill fallback.
- No partial-success ambiguity for committed read paths.
- Reads against a snapshot MUST reflect exactly the manifest state at commit time.

---

## Public API Surface (v0.6)

The public Volume API is explicit, minimal, and composed from
`VolumeWriter` + `VolumeReader` sub-interfaces:

```go
// VolumeID uniquely identifies a volume.
type VolumeID string

// VolumeSnapshotID uniquely identifies an immutable volume snapshot.
type VolumeSnapshotID string

// BlockRef references a staged or committed byte block within a volume.
type BlockRef struct {
    Offset   int64
    Length   int64
    Path     string
    Checksum string // populated when WithVolumeChecksum is configured
}

// VolumeSnapshot represents an immutable point-in-time view of a volume.
type VolumeSnapshot struct {
    ID       VolumeSnapshotID
    Manifest *VolumeManifest
}

// VolumeWriter defines the write surface for a volume.
type VolumeWriter interface {
    // StageWriteAt writes data at an offset and returns a block handle.
    // Staged data is not visible until Commit is called.
    StageWriteAt(ctx context.Context, offset int64, r io.Reader) (BlockRef, error)

    // Commit records the provided blocks into a new immutable snapshot.
    // The resulting manifest is cumulative: it includes all previously committed
    // blocks plus the new blocks. Commit MUST include at least one new block.
    Commit(ctx context.Context, blocks []BlockRef, metadata Metadata) (*VolumeSnapshot, error)
}

// VolumeReader defines the read surface for a volume.
type VolumeReader interface {
    // ReadAt reads a fully committed range from a snapshot.
    ReadAt(ctx context.Context, snapshotID VolumeSnapshotID, offset, length int64) ([]byte, error)

    // Latest returns the most recently committed snapshot.
    // Returns ErrNoSnapshots if no snapshots exist.
    Latest(ctx context.Context) (*VolumeSnapshot, error)

    // Snapshots lists all committed snapshots.
    Snapshots(ctx context.Context) ([]*VolumeSnapshot, error)

    // Snapshot retrieves a specific snapshot by ID.
    // Returns ErrNotFound if the snapshot does not exist.
    Snapshot(ctx context.Context, id VolumeSnapshotID) (*VolumeSnapshot, error)
}

// Volume composes the full read/write surface for a sparse byte space.
type Volume interface {
    VolumeWriter
    VolumeReader
    ID() VolumeID
}

// NewVolume creates a volume with a fixed total length.
func NewVolume(id VolumeID, storeFactory StoreFactory, totalLength int64, opts ...VolumeOption) (Volume, error)
```

### VolumeOption

Volume accepts a minimal set of options:

- `WithVolumeChecksum(c Checksum)` — opt-in integrity checksums on staged
  blocks. Reuses the existing `Checksum` interface.

`VolumeOption` is extensible for future versions.

### API Constraints

- `StageWriteAt` MUST NOT create snapshot visibility.
- `Commit` MUST be manifest-driven and immutable.
- `Commit` MUST include at least one new block.
- `Commit` MUST validate no overlaps in the full cumulative block set.
- `ReadAt` MUST return `ErrRangeMissing` if any sub-range is uncommitted.
- `VolumeReader` methods parallel Dataset's read surface.
- `Volume` composes `VolumeWriter` + `VolumeReader` (leads the composition
  pattern that Dataset will adopt in v0.7).

---

## Error Semantics

- Missing committed range MUST return `ErrRangeMissing`.
- Overlapping blocks at Commit MUST return `ErrOverlappingBlocks`.
- Empty block list at Commit MUST return an error.
- `nil` metadata at Commit MUST be coalesced to empty (`Metadata{}`).
- Range reads MUST NOT return partial data without error.
- `Latest` on empty volume MUST return `ErrNoSnapshots`.
- `Snapshot` for unknown ID MUST return `ErrNotFound`.
- Stale parent at Commit MUST return `ErrSnapshotConflict` when the store
  implements `ConditionalWriter`.

---

## Concurrency

Snapshot history for a Volume is linear.

### Volume Write Concurrency Matrix

| Pattern | Writers | Blocks | History | v0.6 Status | Future |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Single writer | 1 process | Non-overlapping blocks | Linear (guaranteed) | ✅ Supported | — |
| Multi-process, serialized | N processes, external coordination | Non-overlapping blocks | Linear (caller-enforced) | ✅ Supported (caller owns coordination) | CAS built into Lode |
| Multi-process, uncoordinated | N processes, no coordination | Non-overlapping blocks | Linear (CAS-enforced) | ✅ Safe (CAS) | — |

### Optimistic Concurrency (CAS)

When the storage adapter implements `ConditionalWriter`, Volume detects
concurrent commits and returns `ErrSnapshotConflict`.

The mechanism is identical to Dataset CAS (see `CONTRACT_WRITE_API.md`
§Optimistic Concurrency):
- Commit captures expected parent at resolve time.
- Pointer update uses `CompareAndSwap` when available.
- Stale parent → `ErrSnapshotConflict`.
- Fallback to Delete+Put when `ConditionalWriter` is not implemented.

**Volume CAS retry merges naturally:**
- Non-overlapping blocks from concurrent writers can be merged on retry
  without conflict: re-read `Latest()`, union new blocks with the updated
  cumulative manifest, re-commit.
- Overlapping blocks remain invalid regardless of CAS (see `ErrOverlappingBlocks`).

**Single-writer compatibility:**
- Single-writer workflows are unaffected.
- External coordination remains valid but is no longer required when
  using a CAS-capable store.

---

## Adapter Obligations

No new storage engine type is required.

Existing adapter capabilities remain sufficient:
- immutable object writes
- list/exists/get/delete behavior
- range reads

Adapters MUST preserve manifest-defined truth semantics.

## Storage Layout

Volume uses a **fixed internal layout**. This is not configurable.
The `Layout` abstraction is a Dataset-specific concept and does not apply
to Volume.

```
volumes/<volume_id>/snapshots/<snapshot_id>/manifest.json
volumes/<volume_id>/data/<offset>-<length>.bin
```

- Manifest paths follow the same commit-visibility pattern as Dataset.
- Data files are named by byte range for debuggability.
- This layout is an implementation detail, not part of the public API.

---

## Dataset Boundary

`Dataset` and `Volume` are coequal abstractions with distinct semantics:

- Dataset streaming: atomic construction of complete objects
- Volume streaming: incremental commitment of partial truth
- Neither is a wrapper or special case of the other

If a workflow requires sparse, resumable, out-of-order, or range-verified truth,
it belongs to `Volume`, not `Dataset`.

Design discipline:
- Adapters remain minimal; lifecycle semantics stay in Lode core.
- Runtime-aware policy (scheduling, peer management, execution strategy)
  belongs in consuming systems, not in Lode.

## Complexity Bounds

See [CONTRACT_COMPLEXITY.md](CONTRACT_COMPLEXITY.md) for full definitions and variable glossary.

### Write Operations

| Operation | Store Calls (warm) | Memory | CPU |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|-----|
| `StageWriteAt` | 1 Put | O(block) | O(block) |
| `Commit` | 4 fixed | O(B) manifest | O(B + K log K) |

Cumulative manifest size is O(B). This is inherent in the cumulative design.

### Read Operations

| Operation | Store Calls | Memory | CPU |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-----|
| `ReadAt` | 1 Get + R ReadRange | O(L) | **O(log B + R)** |
| `Latest` | 2 (pointer + manifest) | O(B) | O(1) |
| `Snapshot(id)` | 1 Get | O(B) | O(B) validation |
| `Snapshots` | 1 List + S Gets | O(S × B_avg) | O(S × B_avg + S log S) |

Block lookup MUST be O(log B + R) where R is covering blocks.
Implementations MUST NOT perform per-read sorted-ness checks.
Sort verification MUST occur at manifest load time, not at read time.

`Snapshots()` cost grows with snapshot count × cumulative block count.
Callers MUST NOT use `Snapshots()` on hot paths.

---

## Prohibited Behaviors

- Inferring committed blocks not present in the manifest.
- Treating staged/unverified data as committed truth.
- Implicit background compaction or mutation of committed blocks.

---

## Completeness

A Volume is considered complete when the union of committed blocks covers
the full address space `[0..N)`. Completeness is derived from committed blocks,
not stored as a separate flag.

---

## Invariants

The following invariants MUST hold:

1. A snapshot's manifest is the sole authority for read visibility.
2. Each manifest is self-contained (cumulative blocks, no chain traversal needed).
3. No data may be readable unless referenced by a committed snapshot.
4. All committed blocks are immutable.
5. Committed blocks within a snapshot MUST NOT overlap.
6. Snapshot history for a Volume is linear.
7. Completeness is derived solely from committed blocks.
