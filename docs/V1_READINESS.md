# V1_READINESS.md — v1.0 Release Criteria

This document defines the **non-negotiable criteria** that must all pass
before Lode can be tagged v1.0.

Stability is proven by **usage and time**, not design review.

---

## Gate Rule

- Every criterion below must be checked off with recorded evidence.
- Evidence must reference a real downstream project (or redacted alias), real data, and a real observer.
- No criterion may be waived — if it cannot be met, it must be renegotiated and this document updated.
- The v1.0 tag is blocked until all criteria pass.

---

## Dogfooding Registry

Each downstream project that integrates Lode gets a subsection here.
Use the template to add new projects as they begin integration.

**Privacy rule:** Only public projects are listed by name. Private projects
use a redacted alias (e.g. `private-A`, `private-B`) and must not reveal
internal project names, repo URLs, domain-specific details, or
implementation specifics that could identify the project or its purpose.
Usage profiles and evidence summaries should describe Lode-level behavior
only (e.g. "Dataset round-trip over S3"), not the consumer's architecture
or data model. If a linked issue lives in a private tracker, reference it
as `(private)` instead of by number.

> Issue: #___

- [ ] Option / VolumeOption surface has not expanded since dogfooding began

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

### 2. Manifest Format Freeze

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

- [ ] `VolumeManifest` struct fields unchanged for 4+ weeks

> Issue: #___

- [ ] Owner sign-off on manifest JSON schema as v1.0 wire format

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

### 3. Dataset Dogfooding

- [ ] At least one consumer writing Dataset snapshots to S3 for 2+ weeks

> **Evidence:** Quarry production pipeline writing Hive-partitioned Dataset snapshots to S3-compatible backend (R2) since 2026-02-10. 13 days elapsed as of 2026-02-23; threshold is 14 days. Eligible on 2026-02-24.
> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry
> Summary: Hive-partitioned event and blob storage, deterministic segment layout confirmed idempotent across re-runs. Pending 1 more day to meet 2-week threshold.
> Issue: (private)

- [ ] At least one consumer reading Dataset snapshots back (round-trip) for 2+ weeks

> **Evidence:** Quarry reads Dataset snapshots via prefix listing and segment data files. Full round-trip confirmed but read path requires prefix scan + post-filter (no segment enumeration shortcut).
> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry
> Summary: Partial — reads work but rely on prefix listing rather than manifest-driven discovery for blob files.
> Issue: (private)

- [ ] At least 100 Dataset snapshots committed and read with no corruption

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded — snapshot count not yet confirmed_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: quarry
> Summary: No corruption observed during dogfooding period; exact count pending.
> Issue: (private)

- [ ] No Dataset API changes required to support integration

> **Evidence:** No API changes required during integration. Two performance fixes (v0.7.1 O(n²) write, v0.7.3 latest pointer) were internal improvements, not API changes.
> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry
> Summary: API surface stable throughout integration. Consumer workarounds address missing features (blob manifest), not API defects.
> Issue: (private)

### 4. Volume Dogfooding

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

- [ ] At least one consumer using ReadAt on committed ranges

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

- [ ] At least 3 Volume snapshots committed with cumulative manifests in a real workflow

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

- [ ] No Volume API changes required to support integration

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

### 5. Error Path Validation

> **Evidence:** Quarry handles `ErrNoSnapshots` on cold start (empty dataset, no committed snapshots).
> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry
> Summary: Sentinel correctly returned and handled. Latest-pointer self-healing scan fallback exercised on first access.
> Issue: (private)

- [ ] ErrPathExists observed in real storage confirming immutability enforcement

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

### 6. S3 Backend Verification

- [ ] AWS S3 used for Dataset and Volume writes/reads during dogfooding with no adapter errors

> **Evidence:** Quarry uses the S3 adapter targeting Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible). Dataset writes/reads confirmed working at >100k object scale. No adapter errors observed. Volume not exercised (Dataset-only integration).
> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry
> Summary: Partial — S3 adapter verified on R2 for Dataset path. Volume and native AWS S3 not yet exercised.
> Issue: (private)

- [ ] Non-AWS backend caveat documented in README and PUBLIC_API.md as known v1.0 limitation

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

### 7. Known Limitations Accepted

- [ ] Concurrency model documented in README + PUBLIC_API.md + contracts (single-writer when store lacks `ConditionalWriter`; CAS-based optimistic concurrency when available)

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: CAS optimistic concurrency implemented in #135 (pending merge). Contracts and PUBLIC_API.md already document `ConditionalWriter` and `ErrSnapshotConflict`. README documentation pending.
> Issue: #135

- [ ] Context cancellation cleanup nondeterminism documented as best-effort, no correctness impact

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

- [ ] Deferred test gaps (ITER-LIFECYCLE, COMP-WRAPPER-ORDER, ERR-RANGE-NOT-SUPPORTED) accepted as non-blocking

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —

> Issue: #___

- [ ] CHANGELOG includes v1.0 entry summarizing stability commitment

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

### 9. Blob File Completeness

- [ ] Blob files written alongside structured data within a snapshot are enumerable without prefix-scanning storage

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

- [ ] Consumers can verify which blob files were successfully persisted for a given commit

> **Evidence:** _not yet recorded_
> Date: — | Observer: — | Project: —
> Summary: —
> Issue: #___

### 10. Data Correctness

- [ ] Zero silent data corruption during dogfooding (Dataset or Volume)

> **Evidence:** No corruption observed during ~2 weeks of Quarry production pipeline operation on R2.
> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry
> Summary: Partial — no corruption observed but formal verification (checksum audit) not yet performed.
> Issue: (private)

- [ ] Zero manifest deserialization failures on same-version data

> **Evidence:** No manifest deserialization failures observed during Quarry dogfooding.
> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry

> Date: 2026-02-23 | Observer: @justapithecus | Project: quarry
> Summary: Partial — no inconsistencies observed; O(n²) parent resolution and latest-pointer bugs (pre-v0.7.3) could have caused issues in earlier versions.
> Issue: (private)

## Out of Scope for v1.0

The following are explicitly **not blockers** for the v1.0 release:

- Content-addressable storage
- Zarr codec support
- New codecs beyond Parquet
- Performance benchmarking or optimization
- New storage adapters beyond S3
- Compaction or garbage collection
- Distributed coordination (consensus, lock management)
- Query planning or execution

These may become goals for v1.1+ but must not gate the initial stability release.
