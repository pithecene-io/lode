# SNIPPET_POLICY.md — Markdown Code Fence Conventions

This document defines conventions for code snippets in Lode documentation.

---

## Snippet Categories

### Runnable Snippets

Snippets that can be executed directly or extracted and compiled.

**Markers:**
- Fenced with language identifier: ` ```go `, ` ```bash `
- Contains complete, self-contained code OR references a runnable example
- Annotated with `<!-- runnable -->` comment if verification is required

**Requirements:**
- Must compile (Go) or execute (bash) without modification
- Import paths must be valid
- No placeholder values (e.g., `...`, `<your-value>`)

**Verification:**
- CI job extracts and validates runnable snippets
- Failures block merge

**Verification Strictness (Known Trade-offs):**

The snippet verifier (`scripts/verify-snippets.sh`) has intentionally permissive Go validation:

- Go snippets are wrapped with injected imports (`context`, `fmt`, `lode`) before compilation
- This may produce **false positives**: snippets that pass CI but aren't truly self-contained
- Bash snippets use `bash -n` syntax checking only (not execution)

**Why permissive?**
- Current runnable snippet set is mostly bash (see inventory table below)
- Low complexity keeps the verifier maintainable
- Full Go execution would require careful sandboxing

**Authoritative runtime verification:**
- `examples/*/main.go` files are the authoritative source for complete, runnable code
- `task examples` verifies these at runtime
- When in doubt, add runnable code to an example, not to docs

**When to revisit:**
- If runnable Go snippets become common in docs
- If false positives cause user confusion
- Consider: extracting snippets to temp files with full `go run` verification

### Illustrative Snippets

Snippets that demonstrate API patterns but are not independently runnable.

**Markers:**
- Fenced with language identifier: ` ```go `, ` ```bash `
- Annotated with `<!-- illustrative -->` comment
- May contain:
  - Partial code (no `package`/`func main()`)
  - Elided imports or context
  - Placeholder values (`...`, `// ...`)

**Requirements:**
- Must be syntactically plausible
- Should align with actual API signatures
- Not verified by CI

---

## Annotation Format

Place HTML comments immediately before the code fence:

```markdown
<!-- illustrative -->
```go
ds, _ := lode.NewDataset("mydata", lode.NewFSFactory("/data"))
```

<!-- runnable -->
```bash
go get github.com/pithecene-io/lode
```
```

If no annotation is present, the snippet is assumed **illustrative** by default.

## File-Specific Conventions

| File | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `README.md` | Illustrative | Quick Start snippets are illustrative patterns |
| `PUBLIC_API.md` | Illustrative | API examples are patterns, not runnable programs |
| `examples/*/README.md` | Illustrative | Prose guidance; runnable code is in `main.go` |
| `examples/*/main.go` | Runnable | Full programs; verified by `task examples` |

## Maintenance

When adding new snippets:
1. Determine if the snippet is runnable or illustrative
2. Add the appropriate annotation comment
3. Update the inventory table in this document
4. If runnable, ensure CI verification passes
